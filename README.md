# Django Mini Blog Project
 Django Mini Blog Project

 
In this Project We build a Blog application with Django that allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. The homepage will list all blog posts, and there will be a dedicated detail page for each individual post. Django is capable of making more advanced stuff but making a blog is an excellent first step to get a good grasp over the framework.
